# xKernel

### MicroKernel
Intentions here is not to build another Kernel But to Learn and discover more in concepts of microkernel. I prefer Old C and Make for start. I will use my bootloader repo for starter here so take a look on it too.
We definitely follow UNIX and Linux Concepts and Others Ideas.

### Project Steps
- setup a simple bios is done and we enter protected mode. next step would be implementing memory management.
I would consider memory management and scheduler as core of system.
